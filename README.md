# Upper Body Vertical Control Code

This repo hosts simulator and controller code for biped robots. The controller implements [Upper Body Vertical Control method](https://ai2001.ifdef.jp/uvc/uvc_Eng.html).

# Motivation

I've stumbled upon UVC method while researching bipedal robots and found it very promising. This codebase
is intended for further experimentation on this method and applying it to real robots.
